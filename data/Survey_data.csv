It is coordinated through District administration situated in south. No program in 2020.,2022,Yes,"IMCOH. One health secretariat comprising of Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (Department of Livestock) adequately tackle this issue with priority. One Health program is strengthened and have good link at national level in Bhutan among key agencies BUT very poor delegation in field level. The OH approaches in field level is poor. As a OH scholar i recommend OH orientation program in field level to all key partners or stakeholders. One health approach is active in designing or working on rabies strategy document at national level but often failed or poor in translating or cascading the OH activities in field level as most of counterparts are not aware on such approaches. But through regional office initiatives, we have strengthened at some points. The most holistic approaches is essential of OH collaboration in field level.  There is a National One Health Technical Committee (NOHTC) with mix of human and animal health experts supported by an integarted high level National committee for disease elimination.",No positive nor negative; its COVID era. most of the issues could not be discussed as health focus 100% on COVID-19 pandemic.,"Although COVID-19 pandemic is priority to safe guard human health but other services should not be neglected. End of the day instead of people dying of COVID-19 they will die with other disease, starvation and inadequate supply of services and essentials.  Government has to balance all services appropriately and adequately keeping at the background the COVID-19 protocol as an approach at every step during the implementation of other services and activities. We should change our approach as a new normal different to old normal as changes has to be dynamic. I would like to know the supports from international organizations since each country has rabies elimination document and target as Bhutan targets elimination of dog mediated human rabies by 2030, now without any further supports or change in implementation modalities, the rabies elimination is not possible. With current working system or modalities, the global rabies elimination will fail or not realistic based on field experiences since there is no committed funding nor clear stepwise activities presented to field veterinarians. The international organizations should focus between countries  collaboration especially the cross border rabies prevention and control program. An aggressive prevention program activities are highly recommended in rabies endemic areas like timely vaccination for induction of herd immunity and advocacy programmes. Such program need to be continue with dedicated funding and strict M & E system from external sources. The whole disease elimination process will be affected if it is not supported through grants as there are more priority activities push in whenever there is change in governing bodies.
The source of rabies outbreaks in stray dogs is not able to define or determine, but it is clear that rabies in cattle or other domestic animals are mainly due to exposed to rabid dogs. It is high time to determine the source of rabies in dogs, is it due to wild dogs or carnivores or interaction ? there is not clear information on it so far in Bhutan. "
